* ```user```: folder location for config files to generate users ([example](https://github.com/navikt/crm-arbeidsgiver-base/tree/master/config/users), [documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_scratch_orgs_users_def_file.htm))

* ```package-key```: file location where to save package key (key needed when creating and installing packages) ([documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_dev2gp_config_installkey.htm))

### Permsets to assign (optional)

When creating a new scratch org using SSDX, permission sets can automatically be assigned to the current users. NOTE! These permissions will also be taken into account when running tests. Only add the API names for the permsets, do not include a path.
